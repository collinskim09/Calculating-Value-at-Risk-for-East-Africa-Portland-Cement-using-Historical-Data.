# Risk Management Analysis for East Africa Portland Cement Company

## Business Understanding:
East Africa Portland Cement Company (EAPCC) is a leading cement manufacturing company operating in the East African region. Like any business in the financial markets, EAPCC faces various risks, including market risk, which refers to potential losses due to adverse movements in financial markets.

## Problem Statement:
Value at Risk (VaR) calculation is crucial for EAPCC's risk management strategy. VaR quantifies the potential loss in the value of a portfolio or asset over a specific time horizon at a given confidence level. By calculating VaR, EAPCC can assess potential downside risk associated with its financial investments and take proactive measures to mitigate these risks.

## Expound:
This project involves analyzing historical data obtained from The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to calculate VaR for EAPCC. The analysis includes data preparation, exploration, VaR calculation using the historical method, and interpretation of results.

## Data Understanding:
The dataset obtained from WSJ includes daily opening, high, low, and closing prices, as well as trading volume for EAPCC's stock. This data provides insight into the historical performance of EAPCC in the stock market.

## Data Preparation:
- The dataset is loaded and examined for missing values and duplicates.
- Date column is converted to datetime format and set as the index for time series analysis.
- Unnecessary columns such as volume are dropped for VaR calculation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Line plots are created to visualize trends in opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices over time.
- Histograms are plotted to analyze the distribution of percentage returns.

## Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation:
- Percentage returns are calculated using closing prices.
- VaR is calculated using the historical method, indicating the potential downside risk at a specified confidence level.

## Interpretation and Conclusion:
- Historical VaR analysis suggests minimal likelihood of loss over the specified time period.
- Distribution of returns indicates variability in stock performance with slight skewness towards profitability.
- Approximately one-third of returns are categorized as profit, no return, and loss, respectively.
- EAPCC should continue monitoring market conditions and implement risk management strategies to optimize investment performance.

## Business Implications:
- EAPCC should adopt proactive risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses and capitalize on profitable opportunities.
- Further analysis, including stress testing and scenario analysis, can provide additional insights into the impact of extreme market events on financial performance.

## Conclusion:
- Understanding and managing market risk is crucial for EAPCC's financial health.
- Leveraging historical data and robust risk management practices can help EAPCC navigate market uncertainties effectively and optimize investment performance over time.
